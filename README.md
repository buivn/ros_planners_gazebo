# ROS Interfaces
This work's goal is to provide an Interface connecting from planners to robot's models or physical robots.
The input is a target pose, then the planner gets the pose and the robot models to generate trajectories.
The trajectories are then transferred to the physical robots or sim-robots.

The initial applications aim to:
1. a manipulator - fetch manipulator.
2. Mobile robots
3. Drones
4. Marine robots
